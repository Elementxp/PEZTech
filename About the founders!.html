        <h2>Peyton Gruber</h2>
        <p>
            I am Peyton Gruber, a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of PEZTech, a pioneering organization dedicated to bringing technology education to children in Northern Maine. Alongside my fellow co-founders, Zach and Elliot, I have played a crucial role in shaping PEZTech's mission to empower young minds with the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the digital world.

            My passion for education and a deep commitment to bridging the technological gap have led me to develop innovative programs that introduce children in Northern Maine to the exciting possibilities of technology. My vision extends beyond merely providing access; I envision a future where every child, regardless of their geographical location, has the opportunity to explore, learn, and create using cutting-edge technology.

            My dedication to the cause is evident in the strategic initiatives undertaken by PEZTech. From organizing coding workshops to distributing educational resources, I strive to make technology a tangible and inclusive part of every child's learning journey. Under my leadership, PEZTech has become a beacon of technological empowerment, fostering a new generation of young minds with the skills necessary for the digital age.
            <!-- insert email here -->
            Driven by the belief that every child deserves equal access to educational opportunities, I continue to champion the cause of tech education in Northern Maine. Through PEZTech, my co-founders and I are making a lasting impact on the community, ensuring that children grow up with the skills and confidence needed to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
